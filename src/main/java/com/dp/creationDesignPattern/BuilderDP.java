//	This should be used only when you want to build different 
//	immutable objects using same object building process.

	// The only big difference between this builder pattern and abstract factory
	// pattern is that,
	// builder provides you more control over the object creation process and that’s
	// it.

	// example

//	Let’s discuss a common problem in our application. In any user management module, 
//	primary entity is User, let’s say. Ideally and practically as well, 
//	once a user object is fully created, you will not want to change it’s state.
//	It simply does not make sense, right? Now, let’s assume, our User object has 
//	following 5 attributes i.e. firstName, lastName, age, phone and address.	

	
	//code is in User.java
