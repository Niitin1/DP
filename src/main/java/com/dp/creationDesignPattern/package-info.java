package com.dp.creationDesignPattern;


//Creational design patterns are composed of two dominant ideas. 
//One is encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses. 
//Another is hiding how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.

//Consider applying creational patterns when:

//A system should be independent of how its objects and products are created.
//A set of related objects is designed to be used together.
//Hiding the implementations of a class library or product, revealing only their interfaces.
//Constructing different representation of independent complex objects.
//A class wants its subclass to implement the object it creates.
//The class instantiations are specified at run-time.
//There must be a single instance and client can access this instance at all times.
//Instance should be extensible without being modified.
